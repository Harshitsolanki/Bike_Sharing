## General Information

Linear Regression is one of the most commonly used algorithms in machine learning and statistics used in industry. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. Here is how the simple LR model is represented:

$$ y\ =\ \beta_0+\ \beta_1\ x\ +\ \epsilon $$

where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable.
- $x$ is the independent variable.
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept.
- $\beta_1$ is the slope of the line.
- $\epsilon$ is the error term, representing the difference between the observed and predicted values.

In multiple linear regression (MLR), the model includes multiple independent variables:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon $$

where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p$ are the independent variables.

The coefficients $\beta$ can be calculated using the Normal Equation:

$$ \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y $$

Here, $X^T$ is the transpose of the design matrix $X$, containing the independent variables, and $y$ is the vector of observed values.

MLR has been utilized in this case study in a step-by-step manner to understand, analyse, transform and model the data provided for the analysis. The approach described here represent the practical process utilised in industry to predict numerical target parameters for business.


## Problem Statement

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 


## Business Goal
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusion

Linear regression is a powerful and interpretable algorithm for modeling relationships between variables. By understanding its assumptions, fitting the model, and evaluating its performance, we can make informed decisions and predictions based on data.
